To use the headers from a compiler
----------------------------------

Set your compiler to include from "CSWIs:".  From the source code,
use:

#include <riscos/swi/PREFIX.h>

...where PREFIX is OS, ADFS, MessageTrans, etc.


To generate/update table files
------------------------------

Edit the file !CSWIs.Chunks.  Lines beginning '#' are ignored.  Each
line is a comma-separated list of chunk names (such as 'OS',
'PDriver', etc).

Load the requisite modules.

Run !Collect to cause the configuration file to be processed.  It
waits for a key-press, just in case you didn't mean to do it!

For each chunk NAME, a file 'Tables.riscos.swi.NAME' is generated.
The program will try to locate all valid SWIs beginning with that
name.  If the generated file already exists, and is newer than the
'extra' file or the generator program, it will not be regenerated.


To generate header files
------------------------

THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET on RISC OS, but this is what the procedure
would be:

Run !Generate.  This generates C and assembly header files for each of
the tables in 'Tables'.

'Extras.NAME/h' is inserted in a C header if it exists.  Similarly,
'Extras.NAME/Hdr' for assembly headers.
